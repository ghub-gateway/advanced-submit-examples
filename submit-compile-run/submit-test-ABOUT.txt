Compile and run a submit job on the CCR cluster
==============================================

Included files:
    helloworld-mpi.c
    submit-call.txt
    SLURMHello-srun

These example files enable qualified users to execute a "Hello World" test job on the compute cluster. In order to use submit functionality, you must have access to the Workspace, Jupyter Terminal, or Jupyter noVNC Desktop tool, and be a member of the Submit group. All submit commands are run from the command line.

This example uses the wrapper compiler mpicc to compile simple C code with MPI on the cluster, then run it there. More about Intel MPI compilers and mpicc:

To use this example:

1. Upload the three attached files to a directory in your Workspace. (SLURMHello-srun, helloworld-mpi.c, submit-call.txt)

2. Ensure the executable bit is set on the SLURM script, SLURMHello-srun.

3. Run the command found in submit-call.txt on the Workspace command line:
  submit -v u2-grid-debug-ib -M -n 12 -N 12 -i helloworld-mpi.c ./SLURMHello-srun

The submit software will upload the SLURM script and the C source code to the cluster, and call the SLURM script.

The SLURM script will load the needed modules, compile the C code (mpicc defaults to using gcc) with MPI, and execute it on a 12-core node. Each CPU will output some information.

When the run is complete, stderr and stout files, as well as the object file from the compilation, will be populated in your Workspace directory.
